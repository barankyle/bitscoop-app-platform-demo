# BitScoop App Platform Demo

You can build with any API on the BitScoop platform which makes being a software developer more interesting than ever.
In this demo, we demonstrate how to use Amazon Lambda to fetch daily statistics about your tech stack, store that data in an RDS box, and then serve this data through AWS API Gateway as a microservice.

The [tutorial](./tutorial) folder contains instructions on how to set up a copy of this project on your own.
