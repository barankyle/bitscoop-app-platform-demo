# 2. Install Dependencies
You will need to have node.js and \`npm\` installed on your machine so that you can install the demoâ€™s dependencies before uploading the code to Lambda.

From the top level of this directory run

`npm install`

to install all of the dependencies, then run the command

```
grunt build
```

to zip the project to dist/bitscoop-app-platform-demo-<version>.zip
